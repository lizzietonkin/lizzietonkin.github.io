		<p>It was interesting asking people about their experiences and desires for and with their library website. While the majority of people my age do not heavily use the library, those that do expect a select number of actions, requirements, and features to run as smoothly and simply as possible. I think the most important thing for this project is to focus on simplicity and ease, rather than flashy or fancy features. While I am excited about introducing some new ideas, like a book club forum, other ideas, like an interactive view of what is near a certain book on the shelf, might not be as important.
