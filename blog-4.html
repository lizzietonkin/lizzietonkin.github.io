		<h2>Post 4</h2>
		<p>This week was about setting the foundation for the look and feel of the library website and making decisions that will affect the duration of the project and the final outcome. I have never before created page description diagrams as opposed to in-depth wireframes, so it was a difficult exericise to think of the aspects of what is important, or less important, to a page, as opposed to its location and layout. It was a new and different way to think about the hierarchy of a webpage, and helped me to think about what the page needed. It was difficult! Normally when setting out upon creating wireframes, I will first think of what should go in the main navigation, etc., and work from there. When thinking about the priorities of a page, some things can be in a typical "navigation" situation, like About, Hours and Location, and Contact, but these three things have different levels of importance.
