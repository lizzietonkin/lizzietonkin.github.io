		<p>I learned a lot last week in class and was exposed to many advanced code 'things' that I have never used before. I was really excited to learn how to use Bootstrap, and tried my best on our homework assignment, which was to create working wireframes. I've never done this type of workflow before, rather than creating static boxes in Illustrator and then coding something to look enough like those 'maps.' Bootstrapping, which I'll call it, is extremely helpful to use as a springboard to then manipulate and change to fit your design and functionality needs. The only other time I have worked off of manipulating others' code is changing things around on a CMS site, such as Tumblr or Wordpress.
