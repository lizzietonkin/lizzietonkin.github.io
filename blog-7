		<p>The library project is well under way, and we are at an integral point in the development stage. What I complete this week, establishing the full and robust styling and layout of one page "offline," will determine the final website's aesthetic. I am learning that I get most excited about playing around with styling a webpage, more so than laying down the groundwork and functionality (I suppose because it is easier!). So, I am excited to get into the styling phase, but I definitely still have a lot of work to do establishing the final framework of all of my pages.
